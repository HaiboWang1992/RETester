"Bug 570587 - Unnecessary loss of performance in refactoring
Carsten Hammer 2021-01-23 04:29:46 EST
For Bug 436581 there has been an Assert statement added to help in case of an issue.
Unfortunately because of  Bug 570583 the performance penalty for this use case is higher than it should.

Until https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/equinox/rt.equinox.bundles/+/175187 is merged we should change the code to only call toString() if really needed.

So the code that currently looks like this:

Assert.isTrue(fCUnit.isWorkingCopy(), fCUnit.toString());

should be changed to

Assert.isTrue(fCUnit.isWorkingCopy(), !fCUnit.isWorkingCopy()?fCUnit.toString():""); //$NON-NLS-1$

or

Assert.isTrue(fCUnit.isWorkingCopy(), fCUnit.isWorkingCopy()?"":fCUnit.toString()); //$NON-NLS-1$

whatever you prefer.

The following was extracted from the git log message and placed here instead:

You can log the time spent on this (Microseconds per call) using the
following code:

long start = System.nanoTime();
Assert.isTrue(fCUnit.isWorkingCopy(), fCUnit.toString());
long end = System.nanoTime();
long diff = end - start;
long convert = TimeUnit.MICROSECONDS.convert(diff,TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS);
if (convert > 10) // Just interested in slow calls
    System.out.println("### " + convert);  //$NON-NLS-1$
