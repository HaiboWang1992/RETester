"Bug 95121 - [refactoring] Change method signature refuses to operate on annotation member
David Saff 2005-05-13 10:17:23 EDT
Against I20050513-0010

Given:

import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;


@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface IsTest {
	String setUp() default "";
	String tearDown() default "";
}

Select setUp(), and then Refactor > Change Method Signature.  Error dialog pops
up:  "To activate this refactoring, please select the name of a non-binary
method."  I can understand not wanting to offer Change Method Signature for
annotation members: the only useful things you could do are changing the return
type and the name.  But the error message doesn't seem to match.

Not cirtical for 3.1. Markus, if we have time we should improve the error
message here.
Markus Keller 2005-05-24 05:26:16 EDT
Fixed.
