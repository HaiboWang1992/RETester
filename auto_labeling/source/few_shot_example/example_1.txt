[Bug][Pull Up Refactoring] Pull up method refactoring for method in the inner class fails #1533
Steps to reproduce
Create a class A:
public class A {
    public class BaseInner {}

    public class Outer {
        public int x = 0;
        public void foo(){};

        public class Inner extends BaseInner {
            void innerMethod() { // Pull this method up to class BaseInner
                System.out.println(Outer.this.x);
                Outer.this.foo();
            }
        }
    }
}
Like I commented on the above code, left click method innerMethod, then right click -> Refactor -> Pull Up, set the destination as class BaseInner, and use the default configuration as following, click Finish:

The refactoring is performed without any warning or exception. The refactored program is following, which contains syntax error:
import com.my.hello.retester.A.Outer.Inner;

public class A {
    public class BaseInner {

        void innerMethod(Inner inner) { // Pull this method up to class BaseInner
            System.out.println(inner.x);
            inner.foo();
        }}

    public class Outer {
        public int x = 0;
        public void foo(){};

        public class Inner extends BaseInner {
        }
    }
}
